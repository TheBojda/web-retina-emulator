WRE (Web Retina Emulator)
======

For anyone who has a normal 72/96 dpi display but wants to get a "glance" at how their HTML is rendering for retina displays. It will basically just make your page twice as big, allowing you to quickly see what images are not retina-ready and also point out any CSS properties that may cause blurriness. (like 3d transforms)
